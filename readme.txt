== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Jigoshop eCommerce work with X theme? =

Jigoshop eCommerce will in theory work with any theme, but of course, certain parts may need to be styled using CSS to make them match up - that's why we created the Layout Manager. We've added default styling for Twenty Thirteen,Twenty Fourteen,Twenty Fifteen,Twenty Sixteen and...WooThemes. We're developing custom themes for the plugin - they should be available soon!
